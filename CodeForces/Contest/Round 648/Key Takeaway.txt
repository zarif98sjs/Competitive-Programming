Problem D 
=========
For some weird reason , I dfs-ed from multiple source where the destination was only 1 . Later fixed during the contest .
But , keep your head calm and 
DO NOT MAKE THIS SILLY MISTAKES

Problem E
=========
Always think of opposite case. Here we needed at least k-2 1's which means we needed at most 2 0's .
This key idea leads to the problem solving using Pigeonhole principle.
ALWAYS THINK OF THE OPPOSITE CASE

Problem F
=========
Do some simulation and look for pattern.
When prefixes and suffixes are swapped , the pair{i,n-i-1} always remains same [0 based indexing]
LOOK FOR PATTERN
